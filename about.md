# About

Hi, I'm the person behind ujamstudio.

This blog is where I organize what I learn — lecture notes, project logs,
troubleshooting records, and small things I pick up day to day.
Writing helps me think clearly, and publishing keeps me accountable.

If something here helps you too, that's a bonus.

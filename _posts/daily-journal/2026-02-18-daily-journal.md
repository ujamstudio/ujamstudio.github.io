Here's what I studied during February 16–18:

1. [Lecture 18.01] Newton's Method and Mean Value Theorem
2. [Lecture 18.01] 1/3 of Problem Set 1
3. Organizing notes from the paper: Deep FER 6p ([[deep-facial-expression-recognition-a-survey]] Updated!)

February 16–18 was a Korean national holiday.
I visited my grandmother's house and didn't study much during the trip, but I managed to complete Problem Set 1 across those three days.

Working through the problems made me realize that understanding concepts and proofs isn't enough — applying calculus to real-world problems requires a different kind of practice.

Problem sets take a lot of time, but I think it's worth solving all of them, even after finishing the lectures. Some problems are noticeably harder than what appears on exams, and such problems corrected my misconceptions.

As I haven't built a PDF upload and viewing system yet, I can't upload my solutions and solving process.
I will implement it soon and continue updating my journey consistently.

While studying the Deep FER survey paper, I found that it covers various complex algorithms and network architectures. Although I have a surface-level understanding of them, I think I need to understand them in depth. To reach that goal, I'll need to study Calculus, Statistics, and Linear Algebra more rigorously.

So, I will spend more time on mathematics than on coding for now.

Here's what I studied today:

1. Solving 18.01 Problem Set 1 (Section 1)
2. Reading "Deep Facial Expression Recognition: A Survey" (pp. 1-6)
3. Organizing notes from that paper([[deep-facial-expression-recognition-a-survey]])

I didn't study as much as I wanted to.
I'm still feeling lost.
I have a huge dream, but I don't know the right path.

So, I've started exploring research papers.
I think reading recent papers in my area of interest will help me figure out what I need to study.

Today, I read "Deep FER: A Survey" by Shan Li and Weihong Deng.

It made me realize that I must finish 18.01 (Single Variable Calculus) and start studying multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and statistics as soon as possible.

I'm really happy to have found my way toward my dream.

Although it will be a hard journey, hang in there, Jay.

Hi guys, it's Jay (Minjae Kim).
I'm a freshman at Chung-Ang University, majoring in Art and Technology.  

Today, I'm starting this blog.  
My ultimate dream is to become an AI engineer who develops immersive technology.  

Since early 2025, I've been studying mathematics, computer science, and natural science using open lectures like MIT OCW. Originally, I saved my markdown notes in Obsidian—lecture notes, homework, and organized knowledge. Now, I want to share this learning journey through my blog.  

I will log everything I learn, think, and research here.  
This is a database for one person—me—and it represents my everything.  

I hope someday you won't be able to find this first post, buried under all the content I'll create.

Wish me luck!

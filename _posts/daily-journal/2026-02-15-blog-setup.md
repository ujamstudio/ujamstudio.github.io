---

## What I Did Today

- Created a Jekyll blog structure from scratch
- Set up category-based folder organization
- Wrote the first couple of sample posts
- Pushed everything to GitHub Pages

## Thoughts

Keeping things simple is the way to go. Plain Markdown, minimal CSS, no heavy frameworks. The goal is to write consistently, not to over-engineer.

## Tomorrow

- Write my first real lecture note
- Look into adding a search feature later
